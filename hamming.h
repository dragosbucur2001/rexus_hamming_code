/*
 * AUTHOR: Alexandru-Dragos BUCUR
 *
 * Hamming code was chosen because it is easy to implement and is good enough
 * for the expected error rates.
 *
 * The *maximum* error rate you can set on the RXSM module is 2^-4, so 1 bit
 * error every 2 bytes. So a hamming code of at least (15,11) should be chosen
 * to cover these errors. A (15,11) Hamming Code encodes 11 bits of useful data
 * in 15 bits which will be transmitted, being able to fix 1 bit error within
 * the transmitted 15 bits.
 *
 * I chose (8,4) because it would be more reliable, and because we can
 * comfortably afford the 2x overhead. (8,4) Hamming codes can fix 1 bit error
 * every byte, for every 4 bits of useful data 8 bits are transmitted.
 *
 * NOTE: Why (8,4) instead of (7,4)?
 *
 * A (8,4) has more robust error *detection* compared to (7,4). However, both
 * (8,4) and (7,4) can reliably correct only 1 bit error, so using an additional
 * bit does not really improve anything for our case, because we will always
 * attempt to correct the message.
 *
 * The reason we use (8,4) is to handle *byte drops*. If we were to use (7,4)
 * the following could happen (note that the actual encoding of the parity bits
 * is not correct, and only for demonstration purposes):
 *
 * (Transmitted bits on top, amount of encoded useful data on bottom)
 *
 * 00000001 11111100 00000111 1111
 * ------||------||------||------|
 * 4 bits  4 bits  4 bits  4 bits
 * |-------------||--------------|
 *   1 data byte    1 data byte
 *
 * In the above example, if the RXSM module were to drop the 2nd byte
 * (11111100), we would lose at least 2 bytes of data (potentially more
 * depending on how the decoder is implemented), since the 2nd transmitted byte
 * contains decoding information for both the 1st and 2nd data byte. is a lot
 * less tedious. Theoretically, this could also corrupt 2 whole packets, since
 * the affected 2 bytes could be the final and first byte of 2 different
 * packets.
 *
 * *Most importantly*, this would have an cascading effect, where all of the
 * following encoded bits would be shifted, so the decoder would need to be
 * implemented as a sliding window over the received *bits*, in order to
 * eventually correct itself and not corrupt future correct packets.
 *
 * In comparison, a (8,4) code would do the following:
 *
 * 00000000 11111111 00000000 11111111
 * |------| |------| |------| |------|
 *  4 bits   4 bits   4 bits   4 bits
 * |---------------| |---------------|
 *    1 data byte       1 data byte
 *
 * Now, if we were to lose any transmitted byte, we would lose information about
 * a single data byte, which would corrupt only that specific packet and would
 * not cause a shift in the bits of the transmitted code. In this scenario, we
 * can implement the decoder as a sliding window over the received *bytes* while
 * still being able to skip over corrupt packets without influencing future
 * packets.
 *
 * This makes everything a lot less tedious and less error prone, so I decided
 * that the additional 1 bit is worth it.

 * TODO: Pretty ugly interface, it should have taken just the data and
 * simply return `encoded_bytes`, but i do not want to refactor the tests rn.
 * Also the implementation is pretty messy (but still correct).
 *
 * So these is the fundamental building block for the Hamming(8,4) code.
 * It takes 4 bits of data and transforms it into an encoded byte.
 *
 * The bit positions of `data` are as follow (bit position on top, bit label on
 * bottom):
 *
 * 011 010 001 000
 *  a   b   c   d
 *
 * So, if `data` is 0b1001, then:
 * a = 1
 * b = 0
 * c = 0
 * d = 1
 *
 * The bits of `encoded_byte` will be arranged as follow:
 *
 * 111 110 101 100 011 010 001 000
 *  a   b   c   p3  d   p2  p1  p0
 *
 *  p3, p2, p1, and p0 are parity bits
 *
 *  p0 - is the additional detection bit specified by (8,4), which we do not
 * really use
 *
 * p1, p2, p3 are pretty standard:
